# AI Business Performance Analyst Training Framework
# ================================================

## 1. WHAT YOUR AI AGENT IS (Clear Definition)
Your AI agent is a Business Performance Analyst + Early-Warning System that:
- Reads Power BI–calculated measures (not raw math)
- Understands business intent
- Detects patterns, risks, and anomalies
- Explains WHY
- Recommends what to do next

It supports:
- Sales (performance & recovery)
- Marketing (coverage & penetration)
- Supply Chain (OOS, overstock, seasonality)
- Management (focus & priorities)

## 2. UNIFIED COVERAGE REACH FRAMEWORK (Company → Brand → Item)
AI must treat coverage as a reusable concept, regardless of level.

### Coverage Scope
| Scope | Definition |
|-------|------------|
| Company Coverage | Accounts with ≥1 sale (any brand/item) |
| Brand Coverage | Accounts with ≥1 sale of selected brand |
| Item / SKU Coverage | Accounts with ≥1 sale of selected item |

### Coverage Time Horizons (Rolling)
| Window | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 1Y | ≥1 sale in last 12 months |
| 2Y | ≥1 sale in last 24 months |
| 3Y | ≥1 sale in last 36 months |
| 4Y | ≥1 sale in last 48 months |

Applies to: Customer, Account Group, Channel, Emirate

### Coverage Questions AI Must Handle
- "What is our total company coverage in the last 12 months?"
- "How many accounts bought Brand A at least once in 1, 2, 3, 4 years?"
- "Which accounts bought Item X historically but not recently?"
- "Compare brand coverage vs company coverage"

## 3. OUT-OF-STOCK (OOS) DETECTION Using Sales Data
You don't have inventory → AI infers availability risk from sales behavior.

### OOS Logic
| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Regular sales → sudden zero | Possible OOS |
| SKU sells in other channels but not one | Local OOS |
| Many accounts stop buying same item | Supply issue |
| Demand historically stable → abrupt stop | Availability, not demand |

### OOS Questions (Supply Chain / Planning)
- "Which items had no sales in the last 30 / 60 / 90 days?"
- "Which SKUs stopped selling unexpectedly?"
- "Which items show abnormal drop across many accounts?"
- "Is the decline demand-driven or supply-driven?"

### AI Output:
- Suspected OOS list
- Impacted accounts
- Forecast adjustment suggestion

## 4. RUN RATE & PATTERN DETECTION

### Run-Rate Behavior Types
| Type | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Stable | Consistent monthly sales |
| Seasonal | Predictable peak months |
| Fluctuating | Irregular ups & downs |
| Strange (Spike) | Unusually high |
| Strange (Drop) | Unusually low / zero |

### Run-Rate Questions AI Must Handle
- "Is Item X sales stable or fluctuating?"
- "Which items show seasonality?"
- "Which customers buy Item Y only in certain months?"
- "Which SKUs show abnormal spikes or drops?"
- "Which accounts are at risk of overstock or OOS?"

### AI Output:
- Stability classification
- Seasonal months
- Affected accounts
- Planning implication

## 5. AI THINKING FLOW (How the Agent Reasons)
Every AI answer must follow this non-negotiable flow:
Filter → Measure → Compare → Detect Pattern → Rank → Explain → Recommend

Example: "Why did Item X drop?"
AI does:
1. Filter → Item X
2. Measure → Value, Quantity, Coverage, Bonus
3. Compare → vs history
4. Detect → OOS / seasonality / churn
5. Rank → Accounts impacted
6. Explain → Reason
7. Recommend → Action

## 6. SAMPLE QUESTIONNAIRES (By Business Role)

### A. Management / Leadership
- "Why are we behind target?"
- "What are the top contributors to the decline?"
- "Is growth sustainable or bonus-driven?"
- "Which brands need urgent action?"

### B. Marketing / Brand Teams
- "What is my brand coverage for the last 1–4 years?"
- "Which customers or account group never bought my brand?"
- "Which items lost coverage recently?"
- "Which channels underperform for my brand?"

### C. Sales Managers
- "Which customers stopped ordering?"
- "Which items are not repeated?"
- "Which accounts should I focus on this month?"
- "What are my top risks?"

### D. Supply Chain / Planning
- "Which items may be out of stock?"
- "Which SKUs show abnormal behavior?"
- "Which items are seasonal and when?"
- "Which accounts risk overstock?"

## 7. KEYWORD → INTENT MAPPING

| Intent | Keywords |
|--------|----------|
| Coverage | coverage, reach, penetration, listing |
| Decline | decline, drop, lost |
| Growth | growth, increase |
| Target | gap, vs target |
| Risk | inactive, churn |
| Repeat | repeat, reorder |
| OOS | no sales, stopped selling |
| Stability | stable, fluctuating, strange |
| Seasonality | seasonal, peak, monthly |
| Focus | priority, action |

## 8. INSIGHT & RECOMMENDATION TEMPLATES

### Decline Template
"YTD sales are –8.9% vs LY, mainly driven by:
- Coverage loss (58 inactive accounts)
- Item X not reordered by 42 accounts
- Possible OOS in Channel Y

Recommended Focus:
- Reactivate lost accounts
- Resolve availability
- Reduce bonus dependency"

### OOS / Run-Rate Insight Template
"Item Z shows zero sales for 45 days despite stable historical demand. 
The drop affects 31 customer account groups, suggesting a supply availability issue.

Action:
- Review stock & forecast
- Coordinate relaunch once available"

### Seasonality Insight Template
"Item Y shows seasonal behavior, peaking in Mar–May for Hospital channel.

Planning Action:
- Increase forecast ahead of peak months
- Align promotions with seasonality"

### Target Focus Template
"YTD is –10% vs target (AED 4.0M gap). Closing the gap requires:
- Recovering lost SKU coverage
- Improving frequency in top 20 accounts
- Fixing OOS-related losses"
